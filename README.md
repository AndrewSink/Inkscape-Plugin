# Inkscape-Plugin
Inkscape extension for Line-us developed by Anatoly Besplemennov

The plugin is available from the [Inkscape plugins repository](https://inkscape.org/en/~Line-us/â˜…line-us)

The plugin uses machine co-ordinates and does not do any scaling, so refer to the 
[drawing space diagram](https://github.com/Line-us/Line-us-Programming/blob/master/Documentation/GCodeSpec.pdf)
for details. Note that the Inkscape document units must be set to pixels 
(File/Document Properties/Cusomt Size/Units). For reference a sample drawing is 
[included here.](LineUsTestDrawing.svg)
